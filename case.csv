1,Justice Gulzar Ahmed,Land acquisition,22-Sep-21,"There is a big issue for the Government of Sindh so also the Government of Pakistan to rehabilitate the affectees of the Gujjar Nalah, Orangi Nalah and Mehmoodabad Nalah, in that, the Government of Sindh says that it has no funds altogether to provide for the rehabilitation of the affectees. The statement of the Advocate General Sindh on its face appears to be not reasonable rather such a statement ought not to have been made by the Advocate General Sindh before this Court rather the Sindh Government ought to have stated that as it had stated before this Court which is reflected in the previous orders of this Court, it will do everything to provide for the rehabilitation of the affectees of the above Nalahs. Funding for such rehabilitation is the responsibility of the Government of Sindh itself, in that, as a Government, it has to provide funding from its available resources and the Sindh Government cannot be obliviated of its responsibility. We, therefore, direct the Chief Minister, Government of Sindh to ensure that the affectees of the above Nalahs are rehabilitated by providing them all sorts of amenities, which are required in the present day living. The Chief Minister, Government of Sindh shall ensure that funding is arranged for this purpose and the affectees of the above Nalahs are rehabilitated in all manners preferably within a period of one year. An initial report under the hands of the Chief Minister, Government of Sindh shall be submitted before this Court within a period of two weeks from today. Through the instant CMA, learned counsel for the applicant seeks permission to argue the review petition. We have heard the learned counsel for the applicant.

2,Justice Gulzar Ahmed,Service,24-Mar-21,"The petitioner-Getz Pharma (Pvt.) Limited, has filed these three petitions assailing the common judgment dated 20.11.2020, passed by the learned Single Judge of the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad (the High Court), whereby the three writ petitions filed by the petitioner were dismissed. Respondent No. 1-Muhammad Nafees (the respondent) was employed by the petitioner through letter dated 31.01.2005 as ""Territory Manager/ Hearty"". While working as a Senior Sales Manager (I.B. and A-5 North), through letter dated 04.07.2017, he gave one month's notice to the petitioner of his resigning from employment. Through letter dated 06.07.2017, the petitioner accepted the resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed an application under Section 15 of Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (the Act of 1936) before the Authority claiming amounts as dues payable to him by the petitioner. The petitioner contested the matter before the Authority. The Authority vide its order dated 26.12.2019, allowed the application of the respondent and directed the petitioner to pay the dues to the respondent. The petitioner challenged the order of the authority by filing of a writ petition in the High Court, which by the impugned judgment dated 20.11.2020, was dismissed. Respondent No. 1-Umar Farooq Khan (the respondent) was appointed as ""Territory Manager/ Bravo-11"" vide order dated 005. While working as Senior Sales Manager (Bravo-11) Rawalpindi, he was issued a Show Cause Notice dated 30.11.2017. The respondent submitted his reply and thereafter, the petitioner vide letter dated 30.11.2017, dismissed him from service. The respondent filed an application under Section 15 of the Act of 1936 before the authority, claiming the amounts as due to him payable by the petitioner. The petitioner contested the matter before the Authority. The Authority vide its order dated 26.12.2019, allowed the application of the respondent and directed the petitioner to pay the dues to the respondent. The petitioner challenged the order of the Authority by filing of a writ petition in the High Court, which by the impugned
judgment dated 20.11.2020, was dismissed. isal Siddiqi, learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the very applications filed by the respondents before the Authority were not maintainable for the reason that the respondents, in the first place, were not workmen and secondly, the respondent-Muhammad Nafees had resigned from service under apprehension of his dismissal from service, as he was found to have formed a company by the name of Sun Health Care (Pvt.) Ltd. (Sun Health Care) doing business of pharmaceutical
distributor/ seller and also got the said company registered with the petitioner and started making supplies of the petitioner's medicines to the said company. He contended that on the same ground of forming the very said company, Saeed Akhtar Awan and Umar Farooq Khan, respondents in Civil Petitions No.3588 and 3589 of 2020 were dismissed from service by letters dated 30.11.2017. He contended that being dismissed employees, the respondents were not entitled to grant of dues claimed by them and both the Authority in allowing the claims of respondents and I: the High Court in maintaining the orders of the Authority committed serious error of law. He further contended that the Gratuity and Provident Fund, in terms of Section 15 of the Act of 1936, are payable under the law and the respondents in their application before the Authority, have not mentioned at all under what law the claim for Gratuity and Provident Fund has been made by them. uhammad Bashir Khan, learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, has contended that for making of
claim under Section 15 of the Act of 1936, before the Authority, the respondents were not required to be workmen and the only requirement was to show that they were employed persons with the petitioner. He relied upon a judgment of this Court in the case of Aurangzaib vs Medipak (Put.) Ltd. and others (2018 SCMR 2017). While replying the Court's query, as to under what law the respondents have based their claim for payment of Gratuity and Provident Fund, learned counsel for the respondents contended that it was based upon the Industrial and Commercial Employment (Standing Orders) Ordinance, 1968 (the Ordinance of 1968). We have considered the submissions made by the leaned counsel for the parties and have also gone through the record of the case. All the three respondents have filed their applications before the Authority under Section 15 of the Act of 1936. Subsection (1) of Section 15 is relevant to the controversy in hand, which is as follows: ""15. Claims arsing out of deductions from wages or delay in payment of wages and penalty for malicious or
vexatious claims.-- (1) The Provincial Government may, by notification in the official Gazette appoint any Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation or other officer with experience as a Judge of a Civil Court or as stipendiary Magistrate to be the authority to hear and decide for any specified area all claims arising out of deductions from the wages, or delay in the payment of wages, for non-payment of dues relating to provident fund or gratuity payable under any law,] of persons employed or paid in that area."" The very provision, inter alia, contains that non-payment of dues relating to the Gratuity and Provident Fund, are those which are payable under any 'law'. Learned counsel for the respondents has contended that the respondents have claimed Gratuity and Provident Fund under the Ordinance of 1968. In order to appreciate this very contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, it is essential to examine the provision of the Ordinance of 1968. The Standing Order 12 (6) and (7) are as follows: 12. Termination of employment.- . (6) Where a workman resigns from service or his services are terminated by the employer, for any reason other than misconduct, he shall, in addition to any other benefit to which he may be entitled under this Ordinance or in accordance with the terms of his employment or any custom, usage or any settlement or an award of a Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1969 (XXIII) of 1969), be paid gratuity equivalent to [thirty days, wages, calculated on the basis of the [wages admissible to him in the last month of service if he is a fixed-rated workman or the highest pay drawn by him during the last twelve months if he is a piecerated workman], for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months: Provided that, where the employer has established a provident fund to which the workman is a contributor and the contribution of the employer to which is not less than
the contribution made by the workman, no such gratuity shall be payable for the period during which such provident fund has been in existence. [Provided further that if through collective bargaining the employer offers and contributes to an ""Approved Pension Fund"" as defined in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (XLIX of 2001), and where the contribution of the employer is not less than fifty per cent of the limit prescribed in the aforesaid Ordinance, and to which the workman is also a contributor for the remaining fifty per cent or less, no gratuity shall be payable for the period during which such contributions has been made.] (7) A workman shall be entitled to receive the amount standing to his credit in the provident fund, including the contributions of the employer to such fund, even if he resigns or is dismissed from service. eading of the above provisions shows that they apply to workman and Gratuity is payable to such a workman whose services have been terminated or who has resigned from employment. It provides for payment of Gratuity and lays down
the manner in which it is to be calculated. It further provides that where the employer has established Provident Fund to which workman is a contributor and contribution of the employer is no less than the contribution of a workman, no such Gratuity shall be payable during which the Provident Fund has remained in existence. The Provident Fund including contribution of employer is payable to a workman, who resigns or is dismissed from service. The first moot question is whether the respondents are at all workmen under the Ordinance of 1968 to qualify them to be entitled to the benefit of Gratuity and Provident Fund under this Ordinance. Section 2(i) of the Ordinance contains the definition of the term ""Workman"", which is as follows: ""(i) ""workman"" means any person employed in any industrial or commercial establishment to do any skilled or unskilled, manual or electrical work for hire or reward."" Muhammad Nafees, respondent in Civil Petition No.3587 of 2020, was employed as Senior Sales Manager when he resigned from service. Saeed Akhtar Awan, respondent in Civil Petition No.3588 of 2020, was employed as National Sales Manager when he was dismissed from service. Umar Farooq Khan, Respondent in Civil Petition No.3589 of 2020, was employed as Senior Sales Manager when he was dismissed from service. Learned counsel for the respondents has relied upon the case of Aura nczzaib (supra), wherein this Court was also dealing with a question as to whether petitioner Aurangzaib, who was a Senior Sales Representative, was at all a workman. After examining the job description of the petitioner and the law laid in Pakistan Tobacco Comyang Ltd. vs. Pakistan Tobacco Compang, Emplogees' Union, Dacca and others (PLD 1961 Supreme Court 403), Chairman, Brooke Bond (Pakistan) Ltd. ,Karachi vs. General Secretarq, Union Karkunane .Brooke Bond (Pakistan) Ltd., Rawalpindi (PLD 1969 Lahore 717), .Brooke Bond (Pakistan) Ltd. vs. Conciliator and 6 others (PLD 1977 Supreme Court 237) and Sued Matloob Hassan vs. Brooke Bond Pakistan Limited, Lahore (1992 SCMR 227), this Court has answered the question in J negative i.e. Senior Sales Representative will not come within the definition of the term ""workman"" as defined under the Ordinance - of 1968. We may note that in the case of Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd. (supra) so also in Chairman Brooke Bond Pakistan Ltd., case (supra), the question that came up for determination and decided by this Court was that whether a Salesman could be considered as a workman under the Industrial Relations Act, 1947, Industrial Dispute Ordinance, 1959 and Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1969. While in the case of Sued Matloob Hassan (supra) the Court considered the application of definition of term workman given in the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1969 so also in the Ordinance of 1968. The Court dealt with the matter as follows: 8. A plain reading of the above subsection (1) of section 25-A of the Industrial Relations Ordinance shows that a worker or a workman, who falls within the definition given in above clause (xxviiij of section 2 of the Ordinance can invoke the above provision of the Industrial Relations Ordinance in respect of any right guaranteed or secured to him. Whereas, the above clause (3) of Standing Order 12 contemplates that the services of a workman shall not be terminated nor shall a workman be removed, retrenched, discharged or dismissed from service, except by an order in writing containing the reason for the action. It further provides that in case a workman is aggrieved by the termination of his services or removal, retrenchment, discharge or dismissal, he may take action in accordance with the provisions of section 25-A of the Industrial Relations Ordinance and thereupon the provisions of the said section shall apply as they apply to the redress of an individual grievance. In other words, the above clause (3) of Sanding Order 12 incorporates the provisions of section 25-A of the Industrial Relations Ordinance by reference for the purpose of enabling a workman as defined in clause (i)
of section 2 of the Ordinance to get redress against termination of his services or removal or retrenchment, discharge or dismissal, in violation of above clause (3) of the Standing Order 12. e may observe that as pointed out hereinabove, a workman falling within the definition of ""workman' and ""worker"" given in clause (xxviii) of section 2 of the Industrial
Relations Ordinance can press into service the provisions of section 25-A for the enforcement of any right guaranteed or secured to him by any law or any award or settlement. If the right which is sought to be enforced, is guaranteed or secured by the provisions of the Industrial Relations Ordinance or by the terms of an award or settlement, it is enough that the workman comes within the ambit of the definition given in the above clause (xxviii) of section 2 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance, but in case, the claim of the workman concerned is founded on a provision of any other law, in that event if such law provides definition of a ""workman"", he should besides being covered by the above definition provided for in clause (xxviii) of section 2 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance should also be covered by the definition given in the relevant law. For example, if a workman seeks the enforcement of the rights guaranteed under the various provisions of the Standing Orders Ordinance, he should also fall within the definition of the ""workman"" given in clause (i) of section 2 of the Ordinance. However, in case of termination of employment in violation of clause (3) of Standing Order 12 as pointed out hereinabove, it is sufficient that the workman concerned falls within the definition of the ""workman"" given in clause (i) of section 2 of the Ordinance and he need not be covered by the definition of the ""workman"" and ""worker"" given in clause (xxviii) of section 2 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance."" The Court also dealt with the observation made by Cornelius, CJ., as his lordship then was, in Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd's case (supra) which is as follows: ""I consider that it admits of no doubt, that persons who are engaged exclusively in the field of distribution through proper agencies of the products of the Company, are not assimilable either to the group of workers whose manual labour contributes to that product, or those of the clerical establishment who perform the paper work connected with the operations of the Company. The work of salesman is in a wholly different category from manual work or clerical work, and I feel no hesitation in agreeing with the decision of the Tribunal upon this point, namely, that salesmen do not fall within the definition of ""workmen""."" Thus, the consensus opinion of the Court in the cited cases is that salesman does not fall within the ambit of the term workman. On reading of the judgment of this Court in Aurangzaib 's case (supra), it is quite evident that this Court has been taking consistent view that a salesman by very nature of his work is not a workman and does not fall within the ambit of the term workman. In Sued Mat bob Hassari's case (supra), a 5-Member Bench of this Court has in clear terms held that on the basis of admission and keeping in view the duties of the appellant, i.e., a salesman did not predominantly involve manual or clerical work and as such was not considered to be a workman within the meaning of Ordinance of 1968. Now coming to the present case, the application under Section 15 of the Act of 1936, filed by all the three respondents before the Authority, the respondents have claimed that they have
joined the petitioner's company as a Territory Manager. In para-5 of their applications, the respondents have averred that according to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and Labour Laws, the petitioner is liable to pay damages and interest at bank rate to the applicants till date of payment. The respondents have not at all claimed themselves or pleaded in their applications before the Authority that they were workmen. The petitioner in its reply/written statement has taken a specific plea that respondents were not employed as worker or workman and that they were employed as Territory Manager and at the time of resignation/ dismissal of the respondents, they were working as National Sales Manager/Senior Sales Manager and were employed on contractual terms and on managerial positions. ms from the record and also from the order of the Authority that no evidence in the case was led by the parties. We note that where the respondents themselves claim the dues of Gratuity and Provident Fund and that too, under the Ordinance of 1968, on the principle as laid down by this Court in Stied Matloob Hassan's case (supra), it was incumbent upon the respondents to have alleged or taken a specific plea in their applications before the Authority that they are workmen under the Ordinance of 1968 and in case where the employer disputes and denies such allegation/ plea, the burden to prove the fact that respondents were employed as workmen will be upon the respondents, and after they have discharged such burden by leading of positive evidence, the burden will shift upon the petitioner/ employer to establish the fact that the respondents were not workmen. In the absence of the evidence from the side of the respondents and on
the basis of pleadings of the parties, as stood before the Authority, can it be said that the respondents have succeeded in establishing the fact that they were workmen under the Ordinance of 1968. The answer will be altogether in negative, for there is neither any allegation or plea in the applications of the respondents before the Authority that they were workmen under the Ordinance of 1968 nor they recorded their evidence before the Authority to establish the fact that they were workmen and performing manual or clerical work in terms of Section 2(i) of the Ordinance of 1968. The other aspect that was emphasised by the learned counsel for the respondents is that in order to avail the benefit of payment of dues of Gratuity and Provident Fund, the respondents were not required to establish that they were workmen and it was sufficient for them to have established that they were employed persons. This very submission of the learned counsel for the respondents fails to take into consideration that where an employed person has to claim his dues of Gratuity and Provident Fund under Section 15 of the Act of 1936, the dues of Gratuity and Provident Fund have to be those, which are payable under any ""law"". The word payable under any law, in our view, could not be anything else than the law as made by the competent legislative authority and will not stretch to the dues of Gratuity and Provident Fund payable under the contract. The respondents, I by virtue of their contract of employment, as placed on record, were entitled to be paid Gratuity and Provident Fund. This contract of employment of the respondents with the petitioner could not be termed as a law but at best could be considered as to whether it is enforceable in law or not. On the basis of the above discussion, we are of the considered view that the respondents have failed miserably to establish their claim that they were entitled to the grant of Gratuity and Provident Fund as claimed by them in their applications before the Authority. We, therefore, convert all the three civil petitions into appeals and allow the same by setting aside the orders dated F26.12.2019 of the Authority and the impugned judgment 20.11.2020, where it allows granting of Gratuity and Provident Fund to the respondents and claim of the respondents to the extent of payment of Gratuity and Provident Fund is accordingly disseminated.



"
3,Justice Gulzar Ahmed,Service,8-Jun-21,"Facts of the matter are that the respondent was promoted to the post of Office Assistant (BPS-14) in the year 2004 and his post was up-graded to BPS-16 in the year 2014. The service rules were notified on 20.04.2012, providing 90% quota for promotion on seniority-cum-fitness basis among the holders of the posts of Assistant/Accountant, who have completed
five years’ service. In the year 2013, post of Superintendent became vacant. The working-paper for promotion of the respondent was prepared where his name appeared at Serial No.2. The Departmental Promotion Committee (the DPC) was scheduled on 19.06.2017 but it was delayed to 19.10.2017. On 19.10.2017 the case of the respondent for promotion was not considered by the DPC for the reason that he had already retired on attaining the age of superannuation on 21.06.2017. The respondent filed service appeal in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal, Peshawar (the Tribunal), by the impugned judgment dated 12.09.2019, the service appeal of the respondent was allowed and the appellants were directed to consider the case of the respondent for pro forma promotion from the date of his retirement. We have heard the learned Additional Advocate General, KP (AAG) and have also gone through the record of the case. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent has supported the impugned judgment. The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Agriculture, Livestock & Cooperation Department, Peshawar (AL&C Department, KP) issued Notification dated 20.04.2012 containing the rules of recruitment. Working-paper was prepared and the same was sent to the Secretary, AL&C Department, KP vide letter dated 26.05.2017. Model Working Paper, which is at Page-29 of the record shows that there were 08 posts of Superintendent (BPS-17) lying vacant in AE Department. Ninety percent of these posts were to be filled by promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness from the post of Assistant/Accountant having five years’ service. In para-5 of this Model Working Paper appears a chart containing names of 14 Office Assistants. At Serial No.1 is the name of Muhammad Alam, it is mentioned that he has opted to forgo his promotion. At Serial No.2 appears the name of respondent. In the last but one para of this very Model Working Paper, following has been certified by the Director General, AE Department: “It is certified that all the officials included in the panel for promotion:- i. Hold the lower post on regular basis and none of them is holding the post on adhoc basis. ii. No departmental examination has been prescribed for promotion to the post of Superintendent. iii. No disciplinary /Departmental proceeding/anticorruption case /judicial inquiry are pending nor has any penalty been imposed during the last five years against any of the official of the penal. iv. The seniority list of the Office Assistant is final and un-disputed. The very perusal of the Model Working Paper shows that the respondent has completed requisite five years’ service
provided by the rules and the Director General, AE Department, has also certified that there is no impediment in grant of promotion to the persons named in the Model Working Paper. The DPC for considering the promotion was held on 19.06.2017 but was adjourned on the pretext that fresh option of officials forgoing their promotion be obtained. This is mentioned in the letter of the Director General, AE Department dated 28.11.2018 at page-31 of the record. After adjourning of this meeting by DPC, the next DPC meeting took place on 19.10.2017 and in the meantime, the respondent retired from service on 21.06.2017. Learned Additional Advocate General has contended that promotion to the post of Superintendent (BPS-17) was to be made on seniority-cum-fitness basis and this very aspect was to be determined by the DPC and as the DPC having not determined the matter of seniority-cum-fitness, respondent, could not be granted pro forma promotion after his retirement. He has further contended that the case of promotion of Superintendent (BPS-17) was placed before the DPC on 19.10.2017, but it was not considered as respondent has retired on 21.06.2017 and no illegality was committed. He was of the view that only the DPC is competent to consider the grant of promotion and in case, it does not consider or grant promotion, no other forum is competent to decide the question of granting of promotion or pro forma promotion. As to the last submission with due respect, we tend to disagree with the learned AAG for the reason that no doubt it is a function of the DPC to consider the case of promotion of the government servant but where the DPC in violation of law and rules omits to consider or omits to grant promotion, the remedies before statutory Courts/Tribunals are provided by law and such remedies could be availed by the aggrieved government servant and it is for the Courts/Tribunals to consider and decide whether the DPC has validly omitted to consider or omitted to grant promotion in accordance with law and rules. In the present case the DPC has not considered the case for promotion of respondent and the reason assigned is that he has retired. This reason given by the DPC, apparently, is no reason in law, in that, once the Model Working Paper for promotion of respondent was placed before the DPC, it was incumbent upon it to have considered and decided the same, for that, though the law does not confer any vested right to a government servant to grant of promotion but the government servant surely has a right in law to be considered for grant of promotion. It is because of the department’s own non-vigilance and the DPC being insensitive to the employees who were on the verge of retirement of which the employees could not be made responsible, cannot simply brush aside the case of an employee by merely saying that he has retired. Once the case of respondent has matured for promotion while in service and placed before the DPC before retirement, it was incumbent upon the DPC to fairly, justly and honestly consider his case and then pass an order of granting promotion and in case it does not grant promotion, to give reasons for the same. This was not done by the DPC and in our view such was a miscarriage of justice to respondent. In view of the above, we find that the impugned judgment of the Tribunal, directing the appellants to consider the case of promotion of respondent, does not suffer from any illegality and is maintained. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. As the
matter is quite old, we expect that the appellants will decide the question of promotion of respondent expeditiously, preferably within a period of three months from today."
4,Justice Qazi Faez Isa,harrasement,20-Aug-21,"An application has been submitted in Court by five working journalists, including the President of the Press Association of the Supreme Court and the former President of the said Association alleging large scale violations of Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (‘the Constitution’) and that the government and/or organizations/agencies under its control are primarily violating these Fundamental Rights. The applicants state that journalists are harassed, intimidated, attacked and shot at and there are no consequences for the perpetrators and, it is further alleged, that those who should be protecting journalists and ensuring the freedom of the press, guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution, are involved Reference is also made to a ‘Press Release’, attached with the application, which is issued by the Federal Investigation Agency
(‘FIA’) stating that criminal cases have been registered against some journalists because they report against the judiciary. However, the said Press Release does not disclose what was said against the judiciary. Judges of the superior Courts are mandated by the Constitution to ensure that Fundamental Rights are at all times guaranteed and enforced. The said Press Release creates an impression that criminal cases were registered at the behest of the judiciary, and in doing so it portrays the judiciary to be inimical to the guaranteed Fundamental Right of a free press. The FIA appears to have overstepped its legal mandate and to have undermined the peoples’ confidence in the judiciary which is the guarantor of the Fundamental Rights. By such tactics, the respect, regard and confidence of the people in the judiciary may be undermined and the judiciary may also be disrespected and portrayed as standing with FIA. The Director General of FIA (‘DG’) without whose authorization the Press Release may not have been issued or who till date has not retracted it, be issued notice to disclose who authorized the issuance of the Press Release and to submit his personal written explanation why he permitted its issuance mentioning the judiciary and if it was not issued by him then why did he not withdraw it. The DG, FIA is also directed to be present in-person in Court along with the entire original record of the cases against journalists in respect of whom the Press Release was issued and is further directed to submit a complete list of cases filed against journalists, and such list should specify the actual
content, that is transcript of the text, which FIA deemed to constitute an offence The application also complains that journalists are not allowed to work freely and pursue their careers, which is a violation of Article 18 of the Constitution that guarantees right to enter upon any lawful ‘profession or occupation’. Therefore, if a media house/television channel is prevailed upon to sack any journalist because of his/her independent reporting it appears to violate Article 18 of the Constitution. Therefore, notice be issued to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (‘PEMRA’) through its Chairman, who is directed to submit his written response disclosing action taken against the media houses/television channels which resort to such tactics. PEMRA should also disclose its role in ensuring that press freedom is ensured and that all political parties, both in the government and in opposition, receive the same broadcast time in compliance with the reported judgments in the cases of Fatehyab Ali Khan and Muhammad Aslam Saleemi. The ever so frequent attacks on journalists and their abductions, including in the Federal Capital Territory, Islamabad, is another violation of Fundamental Rights which has been raised in the application. It is stated that the Constitution in its Article 9 guarantees the right to one’s liberty and Article 10 of the Constitution safeguards illegal arrests and detention. This matter becomes a matter of concern when the perpetrators are not arrested and, all the more so, when it happens under the cameras of the Safe City Project, Islamabad. Inability in this regard may
suggest incompetence, which may constitute dereliction of duty, or far worse abetment, which is an offence. Therefore, notice be also issued to the Inspector General of Police of the Islamabad Capital Territory and the Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad through its Secretary to separately submit their written replies under their respective signatures listing the number of attacks on journalists, the progress made in the investigation of the FIRs, including identifying the attackers, and whether the recordings from the cameras of the Safe City Project were used to trace out the perpetrators. The amount spent on the Safe City Project be also disclosed. Allegations have also been made that pliant media houses/television channels which agree to project a particular political narrative and suppress a contrary one benefit financially by misusing public exchequer funds as they are given advertisements and other benefits while others are deprived. Therefore, notice be also issued to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad through its Secretary, who is directed to provide details of the amounts paid/disbursed on account of advertisements in the last financial year, till date, and the criteria, if any, used in determining the beneficiaries. Other benefits that may have been given, including foreign trips be also disclosed. The Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad is further directed to disclose the Ministry’s annual budget and the work that it does. The founder of the country, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, as Member of the legislative council had highlighted the freedom and independence of the press at a time when the subcontinent was under direct British occupation and rule. He expressed that a vibrant press, which pointed out wrong doing and highlighted public issues, serves the people and the country’s interest. The question arises whether the expectations that the Quaid had for Pakistan have been achieved, because the applicants have referred to reports which point out that press freedom in Pakistan is at an abysmal level. Reference in the application is also made to Islam. Article 227 of the Constitution mandates abiding by the injunctions of Islam. Propagating the truth is an obligation stipulated in the Holy Qur’an. The Prophet (peace and blessing be upon him) stated that to speak against injustices and tyranny constitutes jihad-e-akbar, the greater jihad. Therefore, let notice be also issued to the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Inter-faith Harmony, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad through its Secretary, who is directed to submit if the Ministry has done anything to ensure that the speaking and broadcasting of the truth is encouraged. Since this is also a matter pertaining to the work which the Ministry of Human Rights, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad should be doing, let it, through its Secretary, submit what, if anything, it has done with regard to the matters complained of in
the application and to state if the allegations which have been leveled are true and, if so, who in its opinion is violating the stated Fundamental Rights. We have decided to treat this application as one under Article 184(3) of the Constitution because it demonstrates that matters of public importance have been raised with reference to the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, including Articles 9, 11, 13, 14(1), 14(2), 15, 18, 19, 19A, 23, 24(1) and 25A and as such it meets the stipulated criteria prescribed in Article 184(3) of the Constitution. Moreover, if the allegations which have been leveled are true then it would be a grave transgression of the Constitution requiring urgent redressal. Notices be also issued to the representative bodies of the press, who we are informed are the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA), the Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE), the All Pakistan Newspaper Society (APNS) and the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) to state whether the allegations made in the application are correct or otherwise. Notices to be also issued to the public sector Pakistan Television Corporation (PTC) and Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) through their respective Managing Directors/Heads, who are
directed to submit in writing whether they are abiding by the guaranteed Fundamental Right of a free press and are complying with the decisions in the above mentioned judgments. The Attorney General for Pakistan and the Advocate Generals of the four provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory to be issued notices under Order XVIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure. The office is directed to number this petition and to array the Press Association of the Supreme Court as petitioner No. 1 and the other signatories as petitioner Nos. 2 to 5. And, to array the aforementioned Ministries, FIA, PEMRA, IG Police Islamabad, PTC and PBC as respondents. Adjourned to 26 August 2021 by or before which date all replies should be filed. Since this Bench of the Supreme Court has taken notice pursuant to Article 184(3) of the Constitution and has heard the applicants at some length let
this case be fixed before the same Bench."
5,Justice Maqbool Baqar,Land acquisition,19-Feb-20,"A property bearing House No.861, Akbari Gate, Lahore, (the property), was being sought by the respondent-bank to be attached and sold before Banking Court IV, Lahore, in the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent bank for enforcement of a judgment and a decree obtained by it for recovery of Rs.32,04,620/- against respondent No.2 and 3. The move was resisted by the appellant through an application. However the appellant’s application was dismissed and attachment as sought was ordered by the Banking Court. The appeal filed by the appellant against the said order has been dismissed by a learned Division Bench of the Lahore High Court through judgment now impugned before us. The judgement and decree sought to be enforced by the respondent bank, was passed by a Banking Court, under Banking Companies (Recovery of Loans, Advances, Credits and Finances) Act, 1997 (the repealed Act), on 11.5.2001 (the judgment and decree). The attachment and sale of the property, as noted above, was sought on the ground that the same, at the time the above judgment and decree was pronounced, belonged to the respondent No.3, who is a judgment debtor in terms of the aforesaid judgment and decree, and the sale of the property by the respondent No.3, after the said judgment, through a sale deed registered on 18.8.2001, being violative of the restriction placed by the Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (the 2001 Ordinance), was/is, as prescribed by the said provision, void and of no legal effect, and the property is thus available and liable to be sold towards the satisfaction of the respondent No.3’s liability under the judgement and decree. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with their assistance. Indeed in terms of sub-section 2 of Section 23 of the 2001 ordinance, sale/disposition by the judgment debtor, of his property, after pronouncement of a judgment and decree by the Banking Court, without a written permission of the Banking Court is void. The text of the above provision runs as follows: “(2) After pronouncement of judgment and decree by the Banking Court, including an interim decree under section 11, no judgmentdebtor shall without the prior written permission of the Banking Court transfer, alienate, encumber or part with possession of any assets or properties and any such transfer, alienation, encumbrance or other disposition by a judgment-debtor in violation of this sub-section shall be void and of no legal effect.” Now, the essential prerequisite for a sale of the nature as described by the above provision, to attract the restriction and to suffer the consequences as prescribed thereby, is the pronouncement of a judgment and decree by “the Banking Court”, such being the Court as described thereby, and therefore the judgment and decree that meets the requirement, is the one that is rendered by the Banking Court and of no other Court. Whereas “Banking Court”, in respect of a case, (i) in which the claim does not exceed hundred million rupees, (as in the present case), and for the trial of offences under the 2001 Ordinance, in terms of section 2(b) (i), (ii) means, a court established under section 5 of the 2001 Ordinance, and in respect of any other case, the High Court. While section 5 of the 2001 Ordinance, enables the Federal Government to establish Banking Courts to exercise jurisdiction under the said Ordinance. Therefore ‘The Banking Court” in the context of section 23(2) of the 2001 Ordinance, is the Court established by virtue of section 5 of the 2001 Ordinance, and the thus the judgment and decree required to invoke the provisions of section 23(2) of the 2001 Ordinance, is the
judgment and decree passed by a Banking Court established as above, and not any other Court and, for that matter, not a Banking Court that was established under the repealed Act. However, in the present case the judgment and decree sought to be enforced and on the basis whereof the respondent-bank has invoked section 23(2) of the 2001 Ordinance, was rendered under the repealed Act and was pronounced by a Banking Court established under the said Act, the same is therefore wholly irrelevant for the purposes of section 23(2) of the 2001 Ordinance, and cannot be of any help to the respondent No.1 in invoking the said provision. Even otherwise the sale deed in respect of the property was executed by respondent No.3, in favour of the appellant on 18.8.2001, prior to the 2001 Ordinance, that was promulgated on 30.8.2001, and whereby the 1979 Act was repealed and replaced by a
new law as such, and upon registration of the sale deed on 11.4.2002, whereupon the property came to be invested in the appellant, vesting its title in the appellant exclusively, from the date the sale deed was executed, i.e. 18.8.2001, from which date the respondent No.3 ceased to have any right or interest in/or over the property at all. The sale/transfer of the property in favour of the appellant on 18.8.2001, thus became a past and closed transaction and could not have been put into jeopardy through an application purportedly seeking to invoke the provision of section 23(2) of the 2001 Ordinance, on 23.8.2004. The 2001 Ordinance does not, either expressly or impliedly, provide for any retrospective application of the provision of section 23(2) thereof, the same cannot therefore operate to reverse or undo a transaction which took effect from 18.8.2001, prior to the date the said provision and the law containing the same, i.e. 2001 Ordinance, came into existence. It is now well settled that when the legislator alters the rights of parties by taking away or conferring any right of action, its enactments, unless in express terms they apply to pending actions, do not affect them1. It is the general rule of the common law that the
statute changing the law ought not, unless the intention appears with reasonably certainty to be understood as applied to facts, or events that have already occurred in such a way as to confer or impose or otherwise effect rights or liabilities which the law had defined with references to past events. Indeed it is true that in terms of section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the transfer of immoveable property of the value of hundred rupees and upwards can be made only by registered instrument, whereas in terms of section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908, a document, which is required to be registered under the said Act, can operate to create any right, title or interest in any immoveable property, only if it is so registered. However, section 47 of the Registration Act, clearly lays down that a registered document shall operate from the time from which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made, and not from the time of its registration. In view of the foregoing, we have found the order of the Banking Court not to be in consonance with law and would therefore allow this appeal and set-aside the impugned judgment."
6,Justice Maqbool Baqar,Tax/Excise Duty,22-Jan-20,"The question involved in the instant petitions is, as to whether despite clear exemption from payment of Federal Excise Duty (“FED”), on internet services, as granted by the Federal Excise Act, 2005 (the Act) in terms of section 3 thereof, through item No.2 of Table-II in the 3rd Schedule of the Act, transmission of voice contents through internet would attract levy of FED, as is chargeable on telecommunication services. The respondent M/s Wi-Tribe Pakistan Limited, which holds a wireless local loop license, was issued a show cause notice for non-payment of FED on account of services falling under the scope of “telecommunication services” rendered for the period from January 2011 to December 2012. Order in original was accordingly passed on 25.2.2014, and the appeal filed by the
respondent there-against failed, however their appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (the Tribunal) was allowed, the Tribunal held that since internet services are exempted from FED, the ‘voice content’ transmitted through internet also enjoys such exemption. The learned Islamabad High Court upheld the Tribunal’s decision through the impugned judgment. Indeed telecommunication services attract levy of FED. Under Section 3 of the Act, the said services are listed at S.No.6 of Table-II, bearing heading 98.12, in the First Schedule of the Act. However one such service, being the internet service, has been exempted from whole of excise duties. Internet service has thus been specified at S.No.2 of the Table-II of the Third Schedule of the Act, which table enumerates the services which are exempted from duty, relevant portion of the said item is, for the ease of reference, reproduced hereunder: Telecommunication services (i) Internet services whether dialup or broadband including email services, Data Communication Network Services (DCNS) and Value added data services.” The above signifies two important aspects in the present context.
Firstly that not all the communication services attract levy of FED, secondly, (a) internet service, in the context of the Act, falls within the category of communication services, and (b) the same do not attract levy of FED. It may be crucial to note here that while granting exemption as above, no exception has been created and no categorization effected, as to the nature, usage, character or application of the internet facility. Thus it can safely be said that all telecommunication facilities availed through internet are exempted from FED irrespective of their nature. Admittedly the respondent, at least in the present context, are internet service provider (ISP), and charges for such service only. Though a customer may utilize internet facility for various different purposes, such as browsing, downloading and/or availing various applications like “WhatsApp”, “Skype”, “Facetime”, “Imo”, for audio, (voice content) and/or visual transmission, however, ISP has no concern with such applications/ facilities, nor does he provides or controls the same or charge any fee/amount therefor. The fee/amount that ISP charges from his customer is for the internet connectivity only. In fact no amount is charged even by the application provider for availing the said application, the facility being free of charge, and also since it has not even been claimed that any rate of any fee or charge has been determined, or prescribed therefor, and whereas telecommunication services were otherwise, liable at the relevant time to duty @ 17% of the charges, and on this corollary, in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Act, the internet services, which fall within the category of telecommunication service also would have, but for the exemption, been liable to FED at the rate dependent upon the fee charge therefor, however since there is a zero charge in respect of internet service, as neither any amount is paid nor is any prescribed, no duty can therefore be charged due to this handicap also. It may also be noted here that the fee charged by an ISP is either by way of a package (fix charges) or on the actual usage of the internet data which is measured in bytes there is however neither any mechanism, device or formula to decipher or segregate such consumption in terms the various utilities the same is put to separately, nor has the petitioner devised any mechanism, criteria or formulate, to achieve the same and has also not framed any rules, regulations or a policy in that regard and rightly so, as the statute itself has not created any segregation and distinction amongst the various uses the internet facility can be put to, while granting exemption. There are no lawful means to determine or charge FED as being sought by the petitioner. It hardly need any mention that the charges on the subject can only be imposed in unambiguous and categorical terms, and not by presuming any intendment. It is now well settled that a fiscal provision of a statute has to be construed literally in favour of the tax payer. As discussed earlier, internet services/facilities are wholly exempted from FED. Nothing extraneous can be read into the relevant entry to qualify or restrict such exemption. The respondent cannot be allowed to be deprived of the statutory benefit through misinterpretation and misreading, as attempted by the department. Even in case of any ambiguity regarding any exemption or concession, the same is to be resolved in a manner beneficial to the tax payer and not in the manner that would lead to obliteration of his rights and liabilities. In view of the foregoing, we have found the impugned judgment, in consonance with the law, the same does not call for any interference by this Court. The petitions are accordingly dismissed."
7,Justice Maqbool Baqar,Service,16-Feb-16,"In response to an advertisement placed by the appellant-bank in the daily “Dawn” for the post of “Management Trainee Officer”. The respondents applied, they passed the written test and were selected in their interview, however, instead of issuing appointment letters, the appellant bank offered them a contract for on the job training as “Management Trainee” for a period of two years on payment of Rs.16,000/- per month and instead of the word ‘salary’ the word ‘stipend’ was used for such payment. Clause vii of the contract provided that the said contract will not constitute employee/employer relationship between the trainee and the appellant-bank, whereas clause ix provided for extension of the training beyond the original period of two years and clause xi stipulated that the training does not offer any guarantee of regular employment in the appellant-bank. The contract, however, through clause iv provided 30 working days annual leave. The respondents, in pursuance of the above were inducted in the appellant-bank. They were posted in different branches of the bank as Grade-II Officers and as Managers also. They were assigned the functions such as authorized to sanction loan, negotiate financial facility with the customers, evaluate the securities and to recovery the finance granted to the customers and thus were functioning as/and discharging their duties with power and authority as could be of any other officer/employee of the equivalent position in the bank. Upon expiry of the above contract, after the prescribed period of two years, the contract on 26.5.2010 was extended for a period of about seven months up to 31.12.2016. However, neither was the employment of the respondents regularized nor were their contracts extended thereafter and the bank instead advertised vacancies for appointment in place of the respondents. We have noted that not only the applications that were invited by the appellant-bank and made by the respondents were, “to fill the positions of MTOs for operations of the Bank in Finance and Accounts”. To catch the attention of the prospective candidates to the advertisement, in fact “Career for Management Trainee Officers” was printed on the top of the advertisement in bold letters and offer/advertisement also promised “payment of competitive remuneration”. From the official summaries placed by the appellantbank through CMA No.989 of 2015, also clearly show that the applications were in fact invited for the “posts of Management Trainee” and that in response to the advertisement, the appellantbank received 8392 applications which were short listed to 1942. The candidates were further short listed for written test and thus 231. candidates were put to such test. Though the candidate securing 45% and above marks in the test were to be considered eligible for interview, however, keeping in view the vacancy position only 30 candidates were called for interview conducted by the Designated Committee and on the recommendations at of the Committee, the competent authority decided that the respondents may be considered for selection in the Head Office and the fields and after that they may be preferred for posting in concerned zone with high merit. The summary/office note further reveals that the above trainees were to be accepted for on job training initially for a period of two years and were to be considered for regular appointment on expiry of contract period upon satisfactory performance and availability of vacancies and further that in case any management trainee fails to join, the next candidate with high merit may be offered the position for posting. The respondents were also required to furnish medical fitness certificate issued by the authorized medical practitioners.E29"
8,Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan,Death Sentence,12-May-16,"This appeal with the leave of the Court has arisen out the judgment dated 30.04.2009 of a Division Bench of the Lahore High Court, Lahore whereby it dismissed the appeal filed by the appellants and answered the Capital Sentence Reference No. 69 of 2006 in the affirmative. Brief facts of the case, as can be culled from the FIR and the statements of the PWs recorded in the Court are that on 23.09.2004 at about 1:30 PM, Husnain Riasat a son of the complainant who was 4 years old left his house to purchase toffees but did not come back. The complainant went far and wide in search of his son, made announcements on loudspeakers of the mosques and also reported the matter in Police Station, Dhulla, District, Gujranwala but of no avail. On the night intervening 24 and 25.09.2004 when the complainant alongwith his brother while searching Husnain Riasat, reached a street adjoining his residential house, he noticed a nylon bag lying near the gate of his factory wherefrom blood was oozing. The brother of the complainant on opening the bag found the dead body of the latter’s son soaked in blood. It was without footwear. “Asif is a dog; it is the result of his cruelty; my blood boils when I see him” were the words written on the bag. Nasir Javed and Qaisar Javed the appellants alongwith their two brothers, Tariq Javed and Asif Javed, the acquitted co-accused, were charged for committing the gruesome murder in a case registered against them under Sections 302/34/364A PPC and 7(a) ATA vide FIR No. 318 of 2004 dated 23.09.2004 at Police Station Dhulla, District Gujranwala. The motive for the occurrence is that the complainant supported one Muhammad Nadeem in a case of murderous assault registered against Nasir Javed appellant and purchased a shop the latter was
working in, which also resulted in exchange of threatening words in between the complainant and the appellants a few days before the occurrence. During the course of investigation the appellants and their acquitted co-accused were found linked with the commission of the crime. After the completion of investigation, they were forwarded to the Court of the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court No. 1, Gujranwala for trial who on its conclusion convicted and sentenced the appellants to death on three counts under Section 364-A, 34, 302(b) PPC and 7(a) ATA and to pay compensation of one lac each or in default to undergo six months S.I., acquitted the coaccused vide judgment dated 25.4.2006 and sent the capital sentence reference to the High Court for its confirmation. The appellants preferred an appeal before the High Court against the conviction and sentence which was dismissed while the capital sentence reference was answered in the affirmative. Learned ASC appearing on behalf of the appellants contended that the occurrence is blind and un-witnessed; that the circumstantial evidence collected during the course of investigation does not form a chain as could link the appellants with the crime; that the last seen evidence, appears to be concocted because of its belated appearance; that the evidence relating to disposal of the dead body at 11:00 PM near the workshop also appears to be concocted when no source of light near or around the place has been indicated in the site plan nor any recovery thereof has been made. Extra-judicial confessions, the learned ASC argued, have been attributed to the appellants and the acquitted co-accused but they being of weak probative worth cannot be used as either evidence or corroborative of the charge, that too, when no reason much less plausible has come forth for making such confession before Ghulam Ahmed, Basharat Ali and Muhammad Zaman. Discoveries so called, the learned ASC argued, cannot boost up the case of the prosecution when none of the pieces of evidence commands credence. Learned ASC appearing on behalf of the respondents contended that motive, last seen evidence, extra-judicial confession, recoveries and evidence relating to disposal of the dead body not only form a chain but connect the appellants with the dead body of the deceased. He next contended that these pieces of evidence when linked together rule out the hypothesis of innocence of the appellants, therefore, both the Courts have rightly convicted and sentenced them. Such finding, the learned ASC maintained, being in line with the principles laid down by this Court for appraisal of evidence in criminal cases is not open to any exception. We have gone through the entire record carefully and considered the submissions of the learned ASCs for the appellants as well as the learned Addl. P. G. Punjab for the State. This case, so to speak, hinges on circumstantial evidence. What tempts the Court to believe this type of evidence is the maxim that men may lie but circumstances don’t. We don’t nor can we doubt and dispute its centuries old well tested wisdom. We rather use it as a touchstone for assessing and evaluating the evidentiary worth of the circumstantial evidence. It enables us to reason unknown from the known if the circumstances are reported fairly and faithfully. Deduction about the guilt of the accused could well be drawn from the circumstances as are well authenticated. But where the circumstances so reported are tinkered and tampered with, or contrived and conjured up, they cannot be accepted without careful and critical analysis. Circumstantial evidence can form basis of conviction if it is incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. This case thus has to be analyzed and adjudged in this perspective. The first significant piece of evidence in this case is motive. The motive for the occurrence is that the complainant supported one Muhammad Nadeem in a case of murderous assault registered against Nasir Javed appellant and purchased a shop the
latter was working in, which also resulted in exchange of threatening words in between the complainant and the appellants a few days before the occurrence. The statement that the complainant
supported the said Muhammad Nadeem remained unproved. In case it is true, it was not of a nature as could drive the appellants to go to such an extreme when the matter between the said Muhammad Nadeem and the appellant Nasir Javed ended in a compromise? How could purchasing of the shop incense any of the appellants to commit such a gruesome crime, when the shop was admittedly purchased by Muhammad Arif, a cousin of the complainant? When, where and in whose presence the appellants exchanged the threatening words with the complainant remained unproved and unsubstantiated. We, thus, don’t think such a tragic incident could be a fall out of a motive of this type. The other evidence in the sequence is that of last seen which has been furnished by PW-11. According to this witness, he and Mohammad Akhtar the abandoned PW saw the deceased in the company of the appellants on a motorbike at 2:00 PM on the day of occurrence. But strangely enough he did not inform the complainant about this episode nor did he report it, notwithstanding, disappearance of the child became talk of the town on the same day on account of its having been proclaimed through the loudspeakers of the mosques in the village. When questioned as to why he remained silent for three days, he replied that he went to Lahore. Accepted, for a while that he went to Lahore and came back three days later. But what about Muhammad Akhtar who did not go anywhere? Why did he choose to be silent? We don’t find any answer to the aforesaid questions. The story of going to Lahore is thus nothing but a lie to lend crutches to another lie. The PW stated that he saw the deceased sandwiched in between the appellants on a motorbike from the shop of Abdul Razzaq. What business this witness had in the village when he is a landlord of village Alipur Chatha and Hafiz Abad. He stated that he came to the Dairy Form of Zafarullah to purchase a buffallow but he was not available. Did he meet anybody on the Dairy Form? Did he inquire from anybody about Zafarullah? If not how did he come to know that Zafarullah was not available? Answers to these questions and examination of the person informing him about Zafarullah could have proved his presence in the village but his failure to answer the questions mentioned above and failure on the part of the prosecution to examine the witness would negate his presence in the village. Given that he was in the village, what brought him to the shop of Abdul Razzaq? His reply was that Muhammad Akhtar wanted to purchase cigarettes. But neither Muhammad Akhtar nor Abdul Razzaq has been examined as PWs. Their examination could have established the presence of the PW and his companion in the shop but failure on the part of prosecution to examine them not only belied his presence in the shop but also gave rise to an adverse inference against it under Article 129(g) of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Given that he was present in the shop of Abdul Razzaq, but how could he see the deceased and the appellants when according to the site plan, gate of the house of the appellants as well as the street across it are not visible from the shop. He craned his presence to the veranda of the shop and then to the corner of the street but this addition appears to be an afterthought as neither the veranda nor the corner of the street has been indicated in the site plan. Given that street as well as the gate were visible from the shop, but what was that extraordinary or unusual which attracted the PW to watch the events with such an amount of keenness particularly when it is not the case of the prosecution that the child was crying or resisting his carriage on the motorbike. Why should the appellants carry the child so openly on a motorbike and thereby expose their identity when their ultimate aim was to do away with him? Both the questions, in the absence of any explanation, raise serious doubt about the veracity of the witness. Testimony of this witness with all his deftness and dexterity does not inspire confidence. We, therefore, don’t feel inclined to place any reliance thereon. Then comes the evidence relating to disposal of the bag containing the dead body of the child. PW-10 furnished the evidence of this episode. According to the PW, he visited workshop of Muhammad Riaz situated at Mohallah Tufail Town, Rajkot District Gujranwala at 11:00/11:15 p.m. but the workshop was closed. He, thus, went to the residence of Muhammad Riaz which was lying on the back of the workshop. He after knocking at the door of the residence was waiting for the response, that he saw the appellants on a motorbike dispose of a nylon bag. The statement accounting for the presence of the witness at the alleged place of disposal of
the dead body of the child is not free from doubt when there is absolutely nothing in the statement to show any emergency necessitating such a dash to the workshop located at a distance of 38/40 kilometers, at such odd hours, notwithstanding, the desired spare parts could be had from the nearby market on the following day. How could he see and identify the appellants when the tubelights which were allegedly lit at the relevant time have not been indicated in the site plan nor have they been recovered. The testimony of this witness appears to be unnatural and even unconformable to common human experience and observation and thus does not inspire confidence. We, therefore, leave it out of account. Next is the evidence of extra-judicial confessions. Evidence of this type because of its being concocted easily is always looked at with doubt and suspicion. It could be taken as corroborative of the charge if it, in the first instance, rings true and then finds support from other evidence of unimpeachable character. If the other evidence lacks such attribute, it has to be excluded from consideration. Extra-judicial confessions of the appellants when examined in this light neither ring true nor agree with truth nor fit in with the surrounding circumstances of the case. The circumstances disclosed therein that the complainant made their lives miserable, implicated them in criminal cases and insulted their mother are not supported by the prosecution evidence. According to the statement of PW-13, the appellants were driven by their immense sense of guilt to make extra-judicial confessions. But why should they make extra-judicial confessions before PW-13, who being closely related to the complainant was expected to do them more harm than good. Why should they make such confessions before the said witness who did not hold any authority nor did he wield any influence as could hold out any hope to the appellants and thereby tempt them to make any confessions. We don’t find any answer to the aforesaid questions nor any other justification for believing them. We are rather amazed to note as to why did the Trial Court and the Court of Appeal believe the extra-judicial confessions of the appellants and discard those of the acquitted co-accused. Notwithstanding all of them suffering from alike infirmities deserve alike treatment. We don’t find any plausible reason to treat them differently. We, thus, hold that the extra-judicial confessions are not worthy of reliance and cannot be taken even as corroborative of the charge. The medical evidence, too, does not support the prosecution version as the swelling on the anus of the victim has not been accounted for. This injury on the face of it would tend to point the accusing finger to some maniac or sadist who derives pleasure from an act of this type. Withholding of the original report of the chemical analysis would give added strength to the inference. We, therefore, don’t think the medical evidence supports the prosecution version. The last piece of evidence consists of recoveries. This evidence at its best can be taken as corroborative rather than evidence of the charge. The reason is that it, per se does not name or nominate any accused, nor does it prove or point to his guilt. It simply supplements the other evidence on the record, if it, in its own rights, inspires confidence. Having thus analyzed, the evidence of recoveries does not inspire confidence as the witnesses attesting them being closely related to the complainant are highly interested. Such recoveries also appear to be contrived and conjured up when nothing incriminating came forth, pursuant to the first raid of the appellants’ house made soon after the occurrence and then everything incriminating so-called popped up from the same places of the house pursuant to another raid made 10/15 days later. The evidence of recoveries against this background has little evidentiary worth. So is the case with the evidence of the handwriting expert whose opinion, that specimen handwritings have been executed cautiously and consciously, not only speaks for itself but takes it far off precision and accuracy. This is but natural because the techniques of this branch of expertise have not been perfected to a level where
opinion based on comparison could be treated as unerring and infallible. It thus follows that none of the pieces of evidence discussed above, either individually or collectively, is compatible with the guilt of the appellants nor is it incapable of explanation on any other reasonable hypothesis than that of the guilt of the appellants. It would not thus be safe to maintain the finding of conviction on this evidence. For the reasons discussed above, we allow this appeal, set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellants and acquit them of the charges. They be set free forthwith, if not required in any other case."
9,Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan,Exit Control List,13-Apr-16,"These petitions for leave to appeal have arisen out of the judgment dated 07.03.2016 of a Division Bench of the Sindh High Court, whereby it allowed the Writ Petition filed by respondent No. 1 and directed the Ministry of Interior to immediately remove the name of respondent No. 1 from Exit Control List (ECL) and allow her to travel abroad if she so desires. The learned ASC for the petitioners contended that where the respondent is charged under Section 156(1)(viii) read with Section 2(s)(ii) of Customs Act, Section 8 of FER Act and Section 3(1) of Import and Export (Control) Act, 1950, removal of her name from the ECL would amount to letting her off for good notwithstanding the case against her is still pending in the Customs Court. The learned ASC next contended that where Section 3 of the Exit from Pakistan (Control) Ordinance, 1981 provided alternate remedy by way of review, resort could not be had to the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The learned ASC next contended that it is the prerogative of the Government to place the name of any person on the ECL if he or she is involved in corruption and misuse of power and authority causing loss to the government’s funds or property; economic crimes where large government’s funds have been embezzled or institutional frauds have been committed; acts of terrorism or its conspiracy, heinous crimes threatening national security; case of key directors of a firm, in default of tax or liabilities of not less than ten million rupees; case of two or more key or main directors of a firm, in default of loan or liabilities exceeding one hundred million rupees; any case in which his or her name has been forwarded by the Registrar of a High Court, Supreme Court of Pakistan or Banking Court; or drug trafficking, therefore, the High Court could not have interfered therewith As against that learned ASC appearing on behalf of the respondent contended that the movement of the respondent, who has been charged under Section 156(1)(viii) read with Section 2(s)(ii) of Customs Act, Section 8 of FER Act and Section 3(1) of Import and Export (Control) Act, 1950, could not be prohibited by placing her name on the ECL that too when she has not committed any of the crimes listed in Rule 2 of the Exit from Pakistan (Control) Rules, 2010. The learned ASC went on to argue that remedy of review could not be insisted upon when it is inadequate and even illusory, nor could the remedy granted by the High Court through a petition under Article 199 of the Constitution be recalled or rescinded on this score. The learned ASC to support his contention placed reliance on the case of Muhammad Aslam Vs. Senior Member (Colonies), Board of Revenue, Punjab and others (2004 SCMR 1587). He lastly contended that mere pendency of a criminal case cannot furnish a justification for prohibiting the movement of any citizen in contravention of the provisions contained in Article 15 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Respondent No. 1, no doubt, has been charged in a case mentioned above which is still pending adjudication in the competent Court of law. But mere pendency of a criminal case cannot furnish a justification for prohibiting her movement. It has never been the case of the petitioners that the respondent is involved in any of the cases listed in Rule 2 of the Exit from Pakistan (Control) Rules, 2010 in general or Rule 2(1)(b) in particular, inasmuch as she has not been charged to have embezzled a large government’s funds or committed institutional fraud. In the absence of any such allegations, we don’t think the respondent’s movement could be prohibited under the Ordinance or the Rules mentioned above. We, however, don’t agree with the argument of the learned Sr. ASC for the respondent that remedy by way of review is inadequate or illusory because such argument would tend to defeat the letter and spirit of Section 3 of the Ordinance. Such argument would also tend to defeat the letter and spirit of Article 199 of the Constitution which provides that “a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any aggrieved party, make an order.” The words used in the Article cannot be lightly ignored or overlooked. Though we don’t feel inclined to recall and rescind the relief granted to the respondent by the High Court on this score at this stage, when we don’t see any tenable ground for prohibiting the movement of the respondent, all the same we would not approve of bypassing a forum provided by law.The apprehension of the learned ASC for the petitioners that where the respondent has been charged for committing serious offences as mentioned above, removal of her name from ECL would amount to letting her off for good, is misconceived as despite removal of her name from ECL, her attendance could still be enforced or dispensed with by the Trial Court in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Cr.P.C. For the reasons discussed above, these petitions being without merit are dismissed and the leave asked for is refused."
10,Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan,Compensation on death,11-May-18,"We have been informed that on 17.12.2017, a suicide terrorist attack took place in the Methodist Church at Quetta. Eight persons lost their lives while 58 were injured. The Federal Government as well as the Provincial Government promised compensation package in the sum of Rs.1 million each for the deceased, Rs.500,000/- for the critically injured whereas Rs.1,00,000/- for less critically injured. It is stated that the Federal Government has made a sum of Rs.26.4 million available to the Provincial Government to be disbursed as compensation. In this behalf the Deputy Commissioner Quetta has been charged with the responsibility of disbursing the same amongst the legal heirs of the victims. We have been informed that before any compensation is disbursed, there is a requirement of a Succession Certificate so that the compensation could be paid to the legal heirs who are lawfully entitled to receive such compensation. According to the record produced before us, out of the 8, the legal heirs of only one has so far submitted the succession certificate. Presumably the applications of the rest are pending before the competent fora. In order to expedite the matter, we direct the Deputy Commissioner Quetta to immediately transmit the amount of compensation lying in his account to the account of the Sessions Judge Quetta, who is directed to ensure that all the applications of the legal heirs are decided within a period of one month from today. As soon as such applications are decided, he shall supervise and ensure that disbursement is made immediately to those found entitled. We have also been informed that the Provincial Government has also released Rs.8 million as compensation which has already been deposited with the Deputy Commissioner Quetta for its release to the legal heirs of the victims. A further sum of Rs.16.2 million has also been released by the Provincial Government for payment of compensation to the injured persons. We have asked the concerned official whether such compensation has been disbursed. He has informed us that the matter is still under process before the District Compensation Committee. We are disappointed and alarmed at the slow pace for which cases of compensation are being processed. It appears that the District Compensation Committee consists of Government officials including the ADC (G), Assistant Commissioner Quetta, Police Surgeon Quetta, Mr. Hakeem Khan and representative of the police department. Let the members of the District Compensation Committee appear before this Court after Juma Prayer today at 2:00 p.m. to explain as to why compensation cases have so far been not decided. We have noticed with dismay that all the injured who were entitled to receive compensation have not so far been paid. This is despite the lapse of number of months. The Compensation Committee comprising of Mr. Naseebullah Kakar, Additional D.C., Quetta, Mr. Babraq Khan, Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Ali Mardan, Police Surgeon and Mr. Jawwad Ahmed, SSP Investigation have been summoned. They have not been able to offer any plausible reason for the delay caused in payment of compensation to the injured. Let payment be made to the persons entitled within three days. Notice is issued to the above named as to why the case of misconduct not be initiated against them departmentally for the delay caused and for the lapse committed by them. Besides why they should not be personally held liable to pay markup to the persons entitled for the period they have been deprived of the money. Let this matter be listed for hearing 17.5.2018 at Principal Seat, Islamabad. It has been complained despite the decision taken by the Council of Islamic Ideology in its 175th meeting held on 28-29th September, 2009 that there was no harm, as per Shariah Injunctions, to refer to the members of Christian community as “Masihi” instead of “Esai”, no steps have been taken by the government in this regard. Let the recommendations of the Council of Islamic Ideology be implemented in letter and spirit and arrangement should be made in all official records, documents, correspondence etc. to refer to the Christian community as “Masihi” instead of “Esai”."
